The optical scanner is project is aims to detect a license plate from a image provided by a camera. An efficient algorithm is developed The main aim behind
the number plate recognition is the storage of information of vehicles with respect to its number plate characters. The information thus can be used to track the
vehicles to detect a license plate in various luminance conditions. This algorithm extracts the license plate data from an image and provides it as an input to the
stage of Car License Plate Recognition. Extracted image of the number plate can be seen on monitor.The scope of this project is to detect the license plate from the given image
and observe the output on monitor. The main aim behind the number plate recognition is the storage of information of vehicles with respect to its number
plate characters. The information thus can be used to track the vehicles. This project can work as a base for future improvements in the field of image
processing, especially in license plate extraction and plate number recognition.
